/**
 * Regression guard for #106: #129 replaced `token === apiKey` with a
 * constant-time compare (timingSafeTokenMatch). Overwatch mutated that merged
 * branch and put the plain-equality line back, and 9 of 9 functional tests
 * stayed green - the two versions behave identically except for timing,
 * which no functional assertion can observe.
 *
 * Two rounds of textual bug-hunting both got beaten: a fixed-substring match
 * fell to a rename (token/apiKey -> supplied/expected), and a windowed
 * shape-match (v2) fell to padding the compare 800+ characters away from the
 * nearest token/apiKey mention. Any fixed window loses to enough padding,
 * and a window wide enough to resist padding swallows the whole file and
 * false-positives. That is structural, not a tuning problem.
 *
 * So the primary control here is inverted: instead of hunting for the
 * infinite set of ways to reintroduce a plain-equality compare, it asserts
 * the fix is present. The #129/#106 regression is defined by one fact: the
 * known Runway auth routes stop calling timingSafeTokenMatch. That fact
 * can't be padded, renamed, or whitespaced away, because the attack has to
 * delete the call to introduce the compare. This checks the call site, not
 * the import - a bypass can leave the import line untouched.
 *
 * Round 3: a text-matching call-site check (`\btimingSafeTokenMatch\s*\(`)
 * is itself beatable by the exact regression this ticket exists to catch -
 * comment out the real call and drop a padded plain-equality compare next
 * to it, and the regex still "counts" the call because it matches text, not
 * code. The call-site check is now an AST walk via the TypeScript compiler
 * API (parsed with the strict TS parser, so a commented-out or
 * string-literal call is not a node in the tree and does not count),
 * scoped to the two KNOWN_AUTH_ROUTES files only. It is not extended to the
 * broad sweep below on purpose - see the scope-limits note.
 *
 * The v2 shape-match sweep is kept below as a broad secondary net over the
 * wider `src/app/api` tree (routes with no known auth helper yet, future
 * files, etc). It is not the primary control.
 *
 * Scope limits:
 * - The shape-match sweep is a heuristic that a sufficiently distant or
 *   restructured compare defeats - see the padding bypass this guard was
 *   rewritten to survive.
 * - The call-site assertion proves the call EXISTS somewhere in the file's
 *   syntax tree. It does not prove the call GATES the request - a real call
 *   to timingSafeTokenMatch sitting in dead code, an unreachable branch, or
 *   with its result discarded would satisfy this check. Proving the call is
 *   reachable from the exported route handler is call-graph analysis, which
 *   this guard does not attempt.
 * - A compare that is isolated far from any token/apiKey identifier, in a
 *   file that also still contains a real, reachable timingSafeTokenMatch
 *   call elsewhere, is caught by nothing here: the call-site check only
 *   asserts a call exists, and the shape sweep's window (200) would not
 *   reach a sufficiently distant compare.
 * - It does not (yet) cover a future third auth route, which would need to
 *   be added to KNOWN_AUTH_ROUTES by hand.
